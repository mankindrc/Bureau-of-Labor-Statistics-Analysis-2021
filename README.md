# BLS Employment Analysis
*Physician Assistants' role in a changing medical space*
<br>
<br>
All scripts and data for BLS data analysis 2021.
<br>
<br>
Note: The raw XML files and CSVs were cleaned for the purpose of this project. Annual OEWS reports from the BLS were cleaned to only include occupation title, occupation code, hourly mean wage, annual mean wage, hourly median wage, annual median wage, and total employment. Outlook/Industry data was cleaned to only show entries for certain occupations.  To use this SQL database, download BLS Employment Datas 2015-2020 and restore. To create your own tables from the raw BLS data, either use the BLS API tool and the cleaning scripts, or use <a href='https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/srgate'>BLS Data Tools</a>. XML files are also available <a href= 'https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm'>on the OEWS data page</a>.

<br>
Note: Using the BLS' API only currently works for the year 2020 when scraping from OEWS surveys. To use the API tool, you will need to create series IDs. More info on this can be found here: https://www.bls.gov/help/hlpforma.htm
